\\
\textbf{A7:} The list of commands as shown in figure \ref{fig:tacacscommands} are all required to enable the TACACS+ services on the router. The commands that have "local" at the end tell the router that if no TACACS+ server responds, look to the local account specified.(if no such local account exists, deny all forms of any attempts to log in) The numbers "0, 1, 7, and 15" refer to the different privilege numbers for a user utilizing the TACACS+ service.
